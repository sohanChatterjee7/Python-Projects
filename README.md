# Python-Projects
My python projects which I made for learning purpose.

Developed a Python based voice assistant to simplify daily tasks through voice commands. It uses Python libraries like speech_recognition, pyttsx3, webbrowser etc. to perform various functions. It helped me to understand various Python libraries and how to use them.
